# DHAIE Ethical Framework & Compliance

## Overview

DHAIE RAI Core adheres to the **DHAIE Ethical Framework v2.0**, a comprehensive approach to building AI systems that respect human dignity, autonomy, and cognitive equity.

**Current DHAIE ECS Score:** 92% (🥇 GOLD)

---

## Five Pillars of DHAIE Ethics

### 1. Active Partnership
**Principle:** Users are active partners, not passive data subjects.

**Implementation in RAI:**
- Explicit consent mechanisms for all data processing
- Transparent purpose declarations in semantic manifests
- User-controlled consent withdrawal at any time
- Clear communication of data usage and implications

**Key Metrics:**
- Consent verification time: <24h
- Subject engagement rate: >75%
- Consent withdrawal response: <1h

---

### 2. Architectural Ethics
**Principle:** Ethics must be embedded in system architecture, not added as afterthought.

**Implementation in RAI:**
- Semantic manifests include `ethicalConstraints` field
- Drift detection monitors ethical compliance violations
- Consent layer integrated into service interaction patterns
- Accessibility requirements in manifest schema

**Key Metrics:**
- Ethical path friction: ≤2 clicks
- Architecture compliance: >95%
- Ethical drift detection rate: 100%

---

### 3. Governance Ecosystem
**Principle:** External oversight through Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).

**Implementation in RAI:**
- Quarterly IEC reviews of system behavior
- Ethical stress testing (≥2/year)
- Public accountability through ECS scoring
- Regular ethics audits with published reports

**Key Metrics:**
- IEC consultation frequency: ≥4/year
- Ethics review cycle: quarterly
- Public report publishing: within 30 days of review

---

### 4. Proactive Evolution
**Principle:** Anticipate ethical challenges before they become problems.

**Implementation in RAI:**
- Continuous ethical impact assessment
- Predictive drift detection for ethical violations
- Regular updates to ethical constraints in manifests
- Community feedback integration

**Key Metrics:**
- Ethical stress tests: ≥2/year
- Impact assessments: continuous
- Mean time to ethical remediation: <7 days

---

### 5. Social Ecology
**Principle:** Technology must reduce inequality, not amplify it.

**Implementation in RAI:**
- Cognitive Gini Index monitoring (<0.40 target)
- Accessibility scoring for all services
- Public good investment: ≥25% of resources
- Open-source contribution to commons

**Key Metrics:**
- Cognitive Gini Index: <0.40
- Public good investment: ≥25%
- Accessibility compliance: >90%

| **Total** | **100%** | | | **92%** |

**Rating:** 🥇 GOLD (90-100%)

**Trend Legend:**
- **↑** Significant improvement (+2% or more)
- **↗** Slight improvement (+0.5% to +2%)
- **→** No material change (±0.5%)
- **↘** Slight degradation (-0.5% to -2%) 
- **↓** Significant degradation (-2% or more)

**Quarter-over-Quarter Analysis:**
- **Improving:** Active Partnership, Social Ecology
- **Stable:** Architectural Ethics
- **Needs Attention:** Governance Ecosystem (declining trend)
- **Watch:** Proactive Evolution (slow improvement)

### Consent Data Model

```json
{
  "consent_id": "uuid-v4",
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "service": "PaymentService",
  "purpose": "cross_border_transfer",
  "data_categories": ["financial", "identity"],
  "granted_at": "2025-10-16T10:30:00Z",

## Social Impact Monitoring

### Cognitive Equity Metrics

**Cognitive Gini Index:** Measures distribution of system complexity across user populations.

```python
# Simplified calculation
def cognitive_gini_index(service_graph):
    complexity_scores = []
    for service in service_graph:
        score = calculate_complexity(service)
        complexity_scores.append(score)
    
    return gini_coefficient(complexity_scores)
```

**Target:** <0.40 (equality threshold)  
**Current:** 0.32 ✅

### Accessibility Distribution

| User Group | Accessibility Score | Target |
|------------|-------------------|--------|
| Visual impairment | 89% | >85% |
| Cognitive diversity | 91% | >85% |
| Low digital literacy | 87% | >85% |
| Non-native language | 88% | >85% |

## Ethical Stress Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Consent Bypass Attempt**
   - System attempts to process without consent
   - Expected: Blocked with alert

2. **Cognitive Overload Simulation**
   - Increase system complexity artificially
   - Measure: User confusion and abandonment rates

3. **Data Minimization Violation**
   - Service requests excessive data
   - Expected: Manifest validation failure

4. **Accessibility Degradation**
   - Test with assistive technologies
   - Measure: Task completion rates

### Results (2025 H2)

| Test | Status | Findings |
|------|--------|----------|
| Consent Bypass | ✅ Pass | All attempts blocked |
| Cognitive Overload | ✅ Pass | Gini index stayed <0.40 |
| Data Minimization | ⚠️ Warning | 2 services over-collected |
| Accessibility | ✅ Pass | All benchmarks met |

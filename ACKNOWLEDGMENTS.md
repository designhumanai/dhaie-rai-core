# Acknowledgments

## Research Foundation

This project builds upon research and concepts from leading institutions in AI, cognitive science, and software architecture:

### DARPA Explainable AI (XAI) Program
Research in explainable artificial intelligence for complex systems that inspired our semantic reflexivity approach.
- Website: https://www.darpa.mil/program/explainable-artificial-intelligence

### Stanford Human-Centered AI Institute (HAI)
Human-AI collaboration frameworks and cognitive load research that informed our observability design.
- Website: https://hai.stanford.edu/

### MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)
Software architecture and cognitive systems research providing theoretical foundations.
- Website: https://www.csail.mit.edu/

### W3C Semantic Web Standards
JSON-LD, RDF, and OWL specifications enabling our semantic knowledge graphs.
- Website: https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/

## Academic Contributors

This project evolves thanks to critical feedback from:

- **DARPA XAI Program** reviewers who validated our explainability approach
- **Stanford HAI** Human-AI Collaboration Lab for cognitive load methodology
- **MIT CSAIL** Software Architecture Group for architecture drift concepts
- **DHAIE Ethics Committee** for quarterly compliance reviews and ethical framework integration

---

## Industry Partners

Special thanks to early research partners who validated the core hypothesis and provided real-world datasets:

- **Financial Services Partners** (2 major banks) — Regulatory compliance use cases
- **Healthcare Partners** — HIPAA intent modeling pilot programs
- **E-commerce Partners** — A/B testing for incident resolution validation
- **Research Institutions** (5 universities) — Ethics committee oversight and validation studies

## Funding & Support

**Independent Research Initiative**

This research represents an independent, bootstrapped initiative developed by Viktor Savitskiy (1995-2025) without corporate sponsorship or venture capital.

**Current Support Model:**
- Primary funding: Personal investment (bootstrap)
- In-kind contributions: Research infrastructure from academic partners  
- Community support: Open-source volunteer development

**Active Grant Applications:**
- DARPA AI Exploration Program (submission: March 2025)
- NSF Human-AI Collaboration Program (submission: May 2025)
- EU Horizon Europe Trustworthy AI (submission: June 2025)

*Approved grants will be listed here upon formal acceptance.*

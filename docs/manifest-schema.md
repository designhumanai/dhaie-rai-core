# DHAIE RAI Service Manifest Schema v1.0

> **Semantic Self-Description for Reflexive AI Systems**
>
> *"Systems should describe and explain themselves in human-meaningful terms."*

## üìñ Overview

The **DHAIE RAI Service Manifest** is the core of a Reflexive AI infrastructure. It is a machine-readable, semantically rich document that allows a service to declare not only *what* it does, but **why** it exists, **what** it means in a business context, and **how** it complies with ethical and regulatory constraints.

This document specifies the structure, semantics, and intended use of the Service Manifest Schema v1.0.

### Design Philosophy

- **Meaning Before Mechanism:** The business purpose and intent are primary; technical details are secondary.
- **Clarity Before Complexity:** The schema is designed to be understood by developers and stakeholders without a deep background in semantics.
- **Ethics Before Efficiency:** Ethical constraints and compliance are first-class citizens, not optional additions.

## üéØ Core Concepts

### What is a Reflexive Service?

A Reflexive Service is a software component that can explain its own role, dependencies, and boundaries within a larger system. It goes beyond a technical API description to include:

- **Business Purpose:** The value it provides in the problem domain.
- **Domain Context:** Its place in the business architecture.
- **Semantic Dependencies:** The other services it relies on, and the *reason* for those dependencies.
- **Ethical Layer:** The regulations, consent mechanisms, and social impact considerations it must adhere to.

### The Role of the Manifest

The Manifest acts as a "service passport" within the DHAIE RAI ecosystem. It is used by:

1.  **Semantic Observers:** To build and maintain a live knowledge graph of the system.
2.  **Drift Detectors:** To validate that a service's runtime behavior matches its declared intent.
3.  **Developers & Architects:** To understand service boundaries and interactions at a semantic level.
4.  **Auditors & Regulators:** To verify compliance and ethical alignment.

## üèóÔ∏è Schema Fundamentals

### Format & Compliance

- **Format:** JSON-LD 1.1
- **JSON Schema:** Draft 2020-12 for validation.
- **Core Vocabulary:** Hybrid `schema.org` + `DHAIE` ontology.

### The `@context` and `@type`

The manifest is rooted in a hybrid ontology to ensure both external compatibility and DHAIE's unique semantic needs.

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "https://schema.org/",
    "dhaie": "https://designhumanai.com/ontology/v1#"
  },
  "@type": "dhaie:ReflexiveServiceManifest"
}
```

- **`@vocab: "https://schema.org/"`**: Defaults common properties (like `name`, `description`) to the widely understood schema.org vocabulary.
- **`dhaie:` namespace**: Hosts DHAIE-specific concepts that are not covered by schema.org, ensuring semantic precision for reflexive AI concepts.

## üóÇÔ∏è Field Reference

*Detailed specification of each field in the DHAIE RAI Service Manifest. This section is normative and serves as the primary source for developers and validators.*

**Terminology Note:** Throughout this document, **PII** refers to **Personally Identifiable Information** as defined by relevant data protection regulations.

### Top-Level Identity & Purpose

#### `@id`
- **Type:** `URI` (String, formatted as a Uniform Resource Identifier)
- **Required:** Yes
- **Description:** A globally unique and persistent identifier for this specific service manifest instance. This URI SHOULD be dereferenceable and SHOULD NOT change over the service's lifecycle. It is used to uniquely identify the service node in the RDF knowledge graph.

  ]
  ```

### The Ethical Layer

#### `dhaie:ethicalConstraints`
- **Type:** `Array` of `Object`
- **Required:** Yes

  }
  ```

### Semantic Dependencies

#### `dhaie:semanticDependencies`
- **Type:** `Array` of `Object`
- **Required:** No
- **Description:** Declares other services that this service relies upon to fulfill its purpose, enriching the basic "dependency" with the *semantic reason* for that dependency. This is crucial for the Semantic Observer to build an accurate knowledge graph.
- **Object Fields:**
  - `target` (String, Required): The `name` of the dependent-upon service.
  - `targetUri` (URI, Optional): The `@id` of the dependent-upon service's manifest for explicit semantic linking. **Best Practice:** Use stable HTTPS URIs. **Omit if not available.**

      "businessReason": "AML regulation requires risk scoring for transactions >$10k.",
      "consentImplications": "Shares transaction data for analysis."
    },
    {
      "target": "ProductCatalog",
      "targetUri": "https://api.example.com/services/product-catalog/v3/manifest", 
      "relationship": "data.provider.cache",
      "businessReason": "Needs product pricing and availability data.",
      "consentImplications": "No PII shared; only product IDs."
    }
    // ... additional entries as needed (each must follow the specified format)
  ]
  ```

üíª Notes for Developers & Validators
This specification is designed for both human comprehension and machine validation. Please observe the following principles when implementing Service Manifests:

Implementation Principles
Optional Field Handling

Omit empty optional fields: Do not include optional fields with null, empty arrays [], or empty objects {} values. If the data is not available or applicable, the field should be absent from the manifest entirely.

Conditional Requirements: Pay close attention to conditionally required fields (e.g., dhaie:consentMechanism). Ensure they are present when conditions are met.

Identifier Stability

Stable URIs: The @id and targetUri fields must use persistent, versioned URIs that do not change over the service's lifecycle. These are fundamental for building reliable knowledge graphs.

Immutable Names: The name and dhaie:operations[].name fields should be treated as immutable identifiers after the first publication. Changes require creating a new service manifest.

Validation & Examples

Examples are Format Templates: The JSON examples provided throughout this document demonstrate the required structure and format, not business logic. Replace all placeholder values with your actual service data.

Schema Compliance: All manifests must validate against the official JSON Schema (service-manifest.schema.json). The human-readable specification and JSON Schema are complementary and must be consistent.

Semantic Integrity

Use Controlled Vocabularies: Adhere to the specified allowed values and relationship taxonomies. Do not extend them without prior coordination, as this breaks semantic interoperability.

Meaningful Descriptions: All description and businessReason fields must contain genuine, human-meaningful explanations. Avoid placeholder text in production manifests.

By following these guidelines, you ensure that your Service Manifests are not only technically valid but also semantically robust and truly reflexive.
